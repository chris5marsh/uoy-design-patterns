# Digital Pattern Library

<div class="lead"><p>The Digital Pattern Library is the collection of user interface components that are used as building blocks when creating web pages and applications for the University of York website.</p></div>

These components solve common design problems, and appear throughout our website. They range from simple elements such as buttons and icons, through to more complex elements such as tabs and accordions.

The pattern library defines the code, appearance and functionality of these components.

The components can be used together in many different ways, which allows us to build a website that has a consistent identity, without being completely rigid in its appearance.

## Example uses

<div class="o-grid__row">
  <div class="o-grid__box o-grid__box--third">
    <figure class="c-figure">
      <img alt="" class="c-figure__image" src="media/pattern-library-example-course.png">
      <figcaption class="c-figure__caption c-figure__caption--below">Structured content such as course pages</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <div class="o-grid__box o-grid__box--third o-grid__box--half@small">
    <figure class="c-figure">
      <img  alt="" class="c-figure__image" src="media/pattern-library-example-content.png">
      <figcaption class="c-figure__caption c-figure__caption--below">Standard website content</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <div class="o-grid__box o-grid__box--third o-grid__box--half@small">
